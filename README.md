# How to play Hangman

[Live App](https://hangman200.herokuapp.com/)

There are 2 letter boxes: Picked Letters and Un-Picked Letters.

Click on the letters in the Un-Picked letter box to make a guess on a letter the word contains.

As you click the letter they will disappear from the Un-Picked letter box
and will re-appear in the picked letter box and won't be able to select the same letter twice.

If the letter selected is a fitting letter all letters in the word that are of that letter
will be revealed.

If however the wrong letter is clicked the letter will still disappear from the Un-Picked
letter box and will reappear to the Picked letter box. For each wrong letter selected the
picture the hangman will progress to be Hanged.

If all letters are found then you will have won the game else you would have caused the
man to be hagged.

At any time the game can be reset by pressing the reset button or by refreshing the page.

HAPPY HANGING!!!
